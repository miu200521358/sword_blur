　　ver1.00.00

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　miu200521358

----------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you for downloading my work.
Please take a moment to review the following before using it.


----------------------------------------------------------------


----------------------------------------------------------------
■　Summary
----------------------------------------------------------------

This tool allows you to add a setting for blade blur that occurs when a sword is moved to a model.
It is mainly designed for Japanese swords, but since there are no restrictions on loading models, you can try it with any model you like.

[Important Notes]

This tool modifies the model to add blur, including "adding materials, adjusting weights, adding bones, and adding morphs."
Therefore, it cannot be used with models that do not permit modifications.
